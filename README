Images can be generated from the POV files using the command `for f in *.ini; do povray $f; done`

The original images were generated with the official 3.6.1 version of povray.
I'm regenerating the images by adding a Version tag in them. They differ a bit but should not be noticeable.

Ideally, the pov files and langues files should be moved to Li-Ri repository and included in the development workflow to generate the png and then the .dat files used at runtime.

The process is:
pov files generates png, the C++ executable from this repository (which is still using SDL1) uses the png and the langues files to generate the .dat files used by the application.
