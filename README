Images can be generated from the POV files using the command `for f in *.ini; do povray $f; done`

The version of povray needs to be 3.6.1 to generate the same images (with a more recent version, they are too bright, maybe some option is now needed, need to check the changelog of povray).

Ideally, the pov files and langues files should be moved to Li-Ri repository and included in the development workflow to generate the png and then the .dat files used at runtime.

The process is:
pov files generates png, the C++ executable from this repository (which is still using SDL1) uses the png and the langues files to generate the .dat files used by the application.
